A little about this project and me:
As of starting this project, I am a 2nd year electrical engineering student.
I started this project becuase I thought it would be fun to mess around something that is powerfull enough to handle any task I would want but low level enough that I can get a proper grasp of things
The reason I chose the stm32f446re Nucleo board is mainy due too the on board st-link V2-1 as I plan to use what I learn in this playground to make more intersting projects
Any resources I use will be mentioned and linked in this README as well as sofware and terminal lines

This is a work in progress!!
This is a completely(almost) from the ground up. 
If you endup seeing this and know how to do something better, please let me know.
Here is are links to the refrince materials
