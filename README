Thank you to Artful Bytes on YouTube, his "How a Microcontrller srtats" video was a huge help. If you want to check it out, you can at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOba73z-dQ&t=1383s 

note to self: 
to compile startup: arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb -c stm32f446xx_startup.c -o startup.o
to complie main: arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb -c myprogram.c -o main.o
to build project: arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb -g -O0   startup.o main.o   -T stm32f446xx_linker.ld   -nostartfiles -Wl,-Map=output.map   -o firmware.elf (switch the .elf to .bin and remove -g for final build)
